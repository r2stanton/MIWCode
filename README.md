# MIWCode

## Contents
- NumpyMIW.ipynb
- - Notebook containing the functions which (for the most part) make up the MIW code
- - Using this to add new functions/test them before sending them to NumpyMIW.py for use in other files.

- NumpyMIW.py
- - Python script containing the code for import in other files (Dynamics notebook)
- - Now that the kernels (at least the exponential) are working more or less, updates will be less frequent to this code.

- DynamicsTest.ipynb
- - Notebook for testing simple potentials/new functions before migrating them over to NumpyMIW

- LibraMIW.ipynb
- - Notebook containing the implementation of MIW forces/potential computation for the gaussian and exponential kernel using the libra matrices.
